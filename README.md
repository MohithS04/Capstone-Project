1.	ABSTRACT

This research paper presents an optimized framework based on data-driven methods to allocate humanitarian assistance through a combination of social-economic and health variables analysis. The model employs clustering algorithms from machine learning to analyze datasets from UN which enables it to classify 195 countries based on their aid requirements. The classification system divides nations into high, moderate and low priority categories through evaluation of Health, GDP per capita, health expenditure, and life expectancy. The system utilizes an API built with Flask and presents analysis outcomes using Tableau interactive dashboards. Such decisions aim to enhance both humanitarian transparency and operational efficiency alongside evidence-based decision processes within emergency relief operation. Through data analytics the system enables stakeholders to accomplish better resource allocation for vulnerable areas thus supplying assistance to populations whose needs are most severe.
2.	INTRODUCTION
2.1 BACKGROUND
The challenge to distribute humanitarian aid with fairness has increased as a core issue in worldwide development initiatives. The urgent necessity for an open and evidence-based system to administer aid has reached its peak because of expanding social gaps and worldwide crises fueled by various pandemics along with political wars and climate change effects. There are multiple barriers within traditional aid distribution because subjectivity prevails while data is partial, and political forces create inefficient patterns of assistance thus preventing proper aid reaching vulnerable populations. 
Data science along with machine learning brings advanced resources that enhance aid program distribution decision-making processes. Weathered socio-economic along with health indicators including GDP per capita, child mortality together with healthcare expenditure enable countries to establish objective clusters according to their relative need. International organizations now have improved capability to find regions of highest need through their empirically validated system leading to improved humanitarian response. 
A new aid prioritization system is under development through this capstone project to use clustering algorithms together with machine learning models for resolving these operational and integration issues. The model integrates multiple global datasets to deliver visual insights that users can obtain via Tableau dashboards and Flask API analysis and sophisticated analytics systems.
2.2	OBJECTIVES
The primary goal of this project is to support data-informed decision-making in humanitarian aid allocation. Our system aims to:
•	How can countries be classified based on socio-economic and health indicators?
•	What methodologies have been used in existing literature for classification?
•	Do mixed-method approaches improve classification accuracy?
•	Which features most significantly influence aid prioritization?

By shifting from reactive to proactive and empirical aid allocation, this project aspires to help organizations maximize the impact of their resources.

3.	MOTIVATION
The worldwide aid system currently does not prioritize need properly because it operates with outdated procedures alongside fragmented statistics and complicated geo-political dynamics. Numerous NGOs struggle to utilize existing extensive information about economy and health because they lack fundamental analytical capability. Such poor efficiency leads to the wastage of large sums of money while preventing necessary resource utilization. We believe technology should connect what we perceive as a fundamental deficiency in service delivery. The development of a transparent recommendation system gives organizations the power to generate data-driven decisions which donors and stakeholders can both recognize as effective and justified. The recent United Nations and World Bank reports show that child mortality rates together with healthcare accessibility and income variability are spreading across different geographic areas. The percentage of aid-receiving countries maintaining consistent reporting declined past thirty percent throughout 2023 thus preventing proper effectiveness tracking. This project provides an urgent solution through a scalable method that uses public information and statistical techniques to produce live cluster-based findings. The team maintains a dedication towards creating a solution which proves technologically sound but also physically executable. The project will deliver an innovative solution to the global aid community that directly enhances the delivery process for critical aid to vulnerable populations.
4.	RELATED WORK
Research in data-driven aid allocation has been an area of growing interest, particularly with the increasing availability of socio-economic and health-related data. Several studies have explored optimization and machine learning techniques for aid distribution.
4.1.  Data Driven Allocation of Development Aid
Jakubik and Feuerriegel (2022) proposed a mathematical optimization approach for distributing development assistance, focusing on maximizing the impact of HIV/AIDS intervention within budgetary constraints. Their work relied on full OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) datasets and assumed constant intervention effects with linear regional impacts. In contrast, our approach extends beyond disease-specific aid by integrating multi-domain socio-economic and health indicators from global datasets such as WHO, UN, and World Bank, ensuring a broader, more comprehensive aid allocation framework.
4.2.	Clustering for Pandemic Vulnerability Assessment
Rizvi et al. (2021) employed K-Means clustering to categorize countries based on vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic, using static indicators such as healthcare facilities and disease prevalence. While effective for policy-level analysis during the pandemic, their approach was limited to a single point in time. Our research builds on this by developing dynamic, longitudinal clusters based on indicators like child mortality, health spending, life expectancy, and GDP per capita. Additionally, we introduce new variables such as health expenditure per capita and net trade balance, offering a more nuanced economic-health interaction analysis.
4.3. Hybrid clustering for Aid Prioritization
Mahmood et al. (2021) presented a hybrid K-Means and Farthest-First clustering technique to classify countries into priority aid levels. Their approach demonstrated improvements over single-model clustering but required clean and consistent input data. Our contribution enhances this methodology by incorporating robust preprocessing, missing value imputation, and silhouette score validation to ensure reliability in real-world applications with incomplete datasets.
4.4	. Casual Machine Learning for Development Aid Allocation
Kuzmanovic et al. (2024) introduced a causal inference framework to optimize development aid allocation by estimating counterfactual treatment effects for HIV/AIDS relief. While technically sophisticated, their model demands extensive computational resources and expert knowledge for interpretation. Our work, in contrast, focuses on transparency and interpretability by using clustering-based models integrated with a Flask API, allowing decision-makers with minimal ML expertise to make real-time, data-driven decisions.
4.5. Geostatistical Mapping of Aid and Need
Bosco et al. (2018) utilized Bayesian geo-statistics to map disparities between development aid allocation and key indicators like child stunting and household poverty. Their study prioritized spatial resolution and mapping accuracy. Our research complements this by incorporating interactive Tableau dashboards with dynamic regional heatmaps and socio-economic clustering insights, ensuring practical usability in NGO decision-making. Our proposed system integrates insights from these studies while addressing key limitations such as static data assumptions, complex model interpretability, and lack of real-time decision support. By leveraging machine learning-driven clustering and interactive visualization tools, we enhance aid allocation effectiveness in a scalable and transparent manner.
5.	SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
5.1. Scope
The scope of this study is to develop a data-driven aid allocation system that prioritizes countries based on socio-economic and health indicators. The system incorporates machine learning-based clustering techniques and interactive visualizations to enhance decision-making for NGOs and policymakers. The primary focus includes:
•	Collecting and integrating global datasets from UN
•	Applying clustering techniques such as K-Means, DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering to categorize aid priority levels
•	Developing a Flask-based API for real-time predictions and decision support
•	Implementing an interactive Tableau dashboard for visualization and analysis
•	Enhancing data completeness through preprocessing techniques such as imputation and feature engineering
•	This project expands the analysis through the combination of data from 28 countries obtained from five different UN Datasets
5.2 LIMITATIONS
Despite its advantages, the proposed system has certain limitations:
•	Static Clustering: Although clustering provides meaningful groupings, it does not dynamically adapt to changing socio-economic conditions in real time
•	Computational Constraints: Advanced machine learning models such as causal inference was not implemented due to their complexity and resource requirements
•	Limited Regional Granularity: The analysis is conducted at the country level rather than subnational regions, which may overlook localized disparities
•	Stakeholder Dependence: Effective adoption of the system relies on policymakers and NGOs actively utilizing the insights for decision-making
•	Ethical Considerations: Data-driven classifications may inadvertently reinforce biases present in source datasets, necessitating careful evaluation and periodic model reassessment
